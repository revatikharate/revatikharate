💼 **Senior Data Scientist** | **Growth Analytics** | **ML Expert**  
📍 Based in NYC | Always exploring data and creativity  
🌟 Passionate about building scalable data solutions that drive revenue and impact ** 

I'm a Senior Data Scientist with 4+ years of experience building predictive models, lifecycle segmentation, and experimentation frameworks that unlock growth and drive monetization. I’ve deployed ML solutions across product, GTM, and marketing functions—like a lead scoring model that boosted revenue by $535K (~128% lift).

I bring a strong blend of technical skills (Python, SQL, A/B testing, forecasting, clustering, cloud ML platforms) and business acumen, with a passion for turning data into actionable insight. My work spans across scalable ML systems, causal inference, and strategic analytics that power product decisions and GTM strategies.

Currently, I'm diving deeper into Git, full-stack development, and collaborative tools to level up my end-to-end impact on data products.
